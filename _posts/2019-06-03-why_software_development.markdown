I grew up in a very technology-minded family and always had a passion for innovation as it related to the maths & sciences. As soon as I was old enough, I began working at the Apple Store in my hometown. I found that, not only did I enjoy, but also had a knack for sharing and teaching technology to those who found it intimidating. It was invigorating to watch people discover what technology could enable them to do for the first time.

In my 5 years post-college working in consulting and product management-related roles, I felt unfulfilled in the sense that my output was very intangible. I wanted to build something that felt real. I enrolled in the Flatiron Schoolâ€™s Intro to Front End Development class, which I attended during weeknights after work twice a week. I immediately felt the reinvigoration and excitement around creation that I felt back in my Apple Store days. Something that began as a skill I wanted to dabble in quickly resulted in the decision to make a complete career change. After such a positive experience with the Flatiron School already, the full-time immersive program was the natural choice.
